             <p class="aboutPara">
                 I have played golf for the past 27 years and was earned a collegiate athletic scholarship at University of Arkansas for 2 years before transferring to University of Oklahoma.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have played from the island of Hawaii to the mountains of Colorado to the deserts of Nevada.
                <br>
                <br>
                Golfing has taught me about the importance of teamwork, pushing past your physical and mental blocks, and never giving up.

             <p class="aboutPara">
                Traveling is one my major passions. When I was a child, my family often took me to the U.S. Virgin islands where the beaches were crystal clear. In high school, I made my first "solo" trip without my family and traveled around Europe (Switzerland, Italy, and France) for 2 weeks.
            <br>
            <br>
                My favorite place to travel to is Japan. My fiance and I have travled her twice over the last 8 years. Our favorite thing to do is see new landmarks, eat delicious katsu and play at the arcade. On October 10th, 2024, my fiance proposed to me at the Hakone-jinja shrine in Hakone. Japan will always have my heart.

             <h3 class="aboutHeader">Weight Lifting</h3>
             <p class="aboutPara">
                I started weight lifting when I was in high school, when my athletic program started a regimented work out schedule to improve our skill set. Since then, going to the gym has been a great outtlet for me and to ensure that I keep my mind and body strong. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thankfully, my fiance is also very passionate about weight lifting and he is able to assist me in providing suggestions, different exercises for strenthening, and overall motivation.

             <p class="aboutPara">
                My sweet siamese seal point cat is named Shinji. Shinji came into our lives when we needed him the most. We lost our 9 month old kitten Shadow in 2021, when he had a rare genetic heart anamoly that was triggered when he went under anesthesia for neutering. In 2022, my parents found Shinji online with a foster mother in Arkansas.
                <br>
                <br>
                Two days later, my parents drove to Arkansas from Oklahooma, picked him up and then drove to Dalls so that I could pick him up at the airport.
                Since then, Shinji has been the light in our lives. 
                <br>
                <br>
                With his sweet snuggles, big beautiful blue eyes, and his playful curiousity he is always able to bring a smile to our faces.
